            <h2>Answer</h2>
            <p>When it comes to pricing, we offer an aggressive policy for our CNG offer!</p>
            <p>CNG vehicles are produced in the Blainville plant in France, thus benefitting from the same purchasing organization
                and industrial facilities as our diesel vehicles. Thanks to this set-up, we have lowered the vehicle prices,
                in order to be competitive compared to our main competitors.</p>
            <p>When you consider the CNG price, you also have to take the total cost of ownership into account. Operating costs
                are reduced by up to 18 % compared to a diesel truck! One reason to this is the lower average price of CNG
                fuel. Another reason is that no AdBlueÂ® is required for a CNG truck. Moreover, CNG vehicles are encouraged
                by authorities. Many cities, regions and countries have incentives in place to help you in your transition
                towards more environmentally friendly solutions, through for example financial help or tax rebate.
