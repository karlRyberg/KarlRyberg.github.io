            <h1 class="black-decore">Our CNG product</h1>

            
                <p>Absolutely! Our CNG offer is versatile; we offer four different CNG models within our D Wide range with dedicated
                    solutions for refuse collection and distribution:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>D18/19 Wide CNG R 4x2</li>
                    <li>D18/19 Wide Refuse CNG R 4x2</li>
                    <li>D26 Wide CNG R 6x2</li>
                    <li>D26 Wide Refuse CNG R 6x2</li>
                </ul>

                <p> The D26 Wide Refuse CNG R 6x2 would probably be suitable! Our CNG offer has some unique features. Let me
                    show you!</p>

                <h2>ENGINE</h2>
                <p>With an 8.9 litre displacement and 320 hp, our CNG engine is able to cover all distribution applications.
                    It has a torque of 1356 Nm, which is higher than on the diesel version. The engine is of spark ignition
                    type.
                </p>
                <p>It is based on Cummins ISL 8.9 litre diesel engine, and does not require AdBlue® or regeneration. The engine
                    is highly reliable engine which is cost-optimized towards maintenance.</p>

                <h1 class="black-decore">Our CNG product</h1>
                <h2>EXHAUST</h2>
                <p>The exhaust can be placed either vertically in the rear right-hand position or horizontally under the frame.
                </p>
                <p>Therefore, our CNG offer addresses both refuse collection and distribution applications with reduced body
                    start and increased space for goods.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container half-page left fill" data-california-sub-page="3">
                <h1 class="black-decore">Our CNG product</h1>
                <h2>TANK</h2>
                <p>There are two different capacities available for our CNG tanks, 90 kg or 120 kg. 1 kg of CNG offers the same
                    operational range as 1 litre of diesel. With the 120 kg tank, your truck can have a range equivalent
                    to a 120 litre diesel tank, up to 400 km. </p>
                <p>Safety is key; that’s why gas tanks are made of steel which can resist 2.5 times their working pressure.
                    Their lifetime is about 20 years.</p>
            </div>

                <h1 class="black-decore">Our CNG product</h1>
                <h2>REFUELLING</h2>
                <p>Refuelling CNG can be done as quickly as refuelling of diesel, in only a couple of minutes! This requires
                    a fast-fill station. The truck can also be refilled with slower filling stations, which takes several
                    hours, but which means a reduced infrastructural installation cost.
                </p>
                <p>In Europe there are 2 standards of CNG connectors, NGV1 and NGV2. We offer connectors meeting both these
                    standards!
                </p>

                <h1 class="black-decore">Our CNG product</h1>
                <h2>GEARBOX</h2>
                <p>The transmission in our CNG vehicles is ideal for local stop and go operation and allows for high level of
                    productivity! The curve of the torque for the spark engine is less flat than for a diesel engine. To
                    compensate for the lack of constant torque, the hydraulic coupler of the automatic transmission is the
                    best solution to maintain the vehicle speed whatever the load. With that the CNG gearbox has a confirmed
                    driving performance!
                </p>
                <p>The transmission is automatic, making the truck easy to handle and increasing driver safety and comfort.
                    We also offer an optional retarder. We recommend equipping a retarder, due to the low engine compression
                    and lack of compression brake on the engine. It improves driving comfort, reduces vehicle operating cost
                    and increase resale value. </p>

                <h2>WHEELBASE</h2>
                <p>To make sure that you can operate on narrow streets in the city, our refuse collector models are compact.
                    They have a wheelbase from 3500 mm, with short rear overhang and short rear air suspension. This allows
                    the driver to operate the vehicle easily, and provides a short turning radius.
                </p>
                <p>The wheelbase of the distribution models is long for optimal loading of goods and pallets. We offer wheelbases
                    of up to 6450 mm here.</p>
