            <p>Carlos meets the description of the customers we target with our CNG offer. Since he owns two CNG trucks, he
                has already invested in the required CNG infrastructure. In addition to this type of customer, we also target
                customers who have the financial means to invest in their own CNG infrastructure as well as larger public
                procurement affairs.
