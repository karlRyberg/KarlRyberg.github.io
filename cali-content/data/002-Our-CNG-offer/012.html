            <p>In this module, youâ€™ve gotten an introduction to our CNG offer, but there is more support easily available.</p>
            <p>Take a couple of minutes and go into Partner Showroom and Partner Proposition. Find the relevant support documentation
                for our CNG offer, and read it. Focus on unique features, and how they meet the needs of your own customers.
                Also check where you can find the CNG model, and how to specify a CNG truck. As a last step, connect with
                a colleague and share your findings.</p>
            <p>When you have done this, connect with a colleague and share your findings. When you are done, continue to the
                next module.</p>
