            <p>
                CNG as an alternative to diesel in urban and suburban operations is something we believe in; that’s why we have invested
                in a competitive CNG offer. To get to know our offer better, you will present it to a customer, Carlos Fortes!
                </p><p>Carlos owns the refuse collection company Reciclaje del Sur. The company operates in a nearby city, as well
                as in the city’s surroundings. He manages 10 drivers in total, and owns a mixed fleet including 5 relatively
                new D Wide trucks and 2 Iveco Stralis CNG trucks. He is now interested in renewing his fleet with 3 new CNG
                trucks.
