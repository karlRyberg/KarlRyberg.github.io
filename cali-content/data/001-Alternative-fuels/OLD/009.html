            <h2>QUESTION 2</h2>
            <p>Which of the following statements describing biogas are correct? (Several answers are correct.)</p>
            <p class="inline-feedback" data-california-quiz-feedback="correct">
                Correct! As you pointed out, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are reduced by up to 70 % in a well-to-wheel perspective.
                Emissions of
                particles are substantially reduced. Biogas is formed in certain conditions when biomass
                decomposes.
                And
                natural
                gas can be used as a fuel both in its gaseous form as well as in its liquid form.

            <p class="inline-feedback" data-california-quiz-feedback="incorrect" data-auto-correct="true">
                That was unfortunately incorrect. Remember, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are reduced by up to 70 % in a
                well-to-wheel
                perspective.
