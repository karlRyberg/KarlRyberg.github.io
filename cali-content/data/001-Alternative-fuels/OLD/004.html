            <p>Over the world, different measures are being taken to stabilise the global warming effect and meet the target
                of a maximum temperature increase of 2.0 <sup>â—‹</sup>C set by the Paris Agreement. To meet this, we need to dramatically
                reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions related to human activity. This concerns all sectors, from energy to residential and
                transportation. In Europe, road commercial vehicles account for 5 % of the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Obviously,
                road transport is not the most important emission contributor. But as we are part of the problem, we need
                to be part of the solution!</p>

            <p>As an example of what is done in the heavy-duty transport sector, a European regulation for CO<sub>2</sub>
                emissions is now being prepared. It will require truck manufacturers to declare individual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for their trucks, starting from 1<sup>st</sup> of January 2019. 
                The aim with this is to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by making sure that only the most CO<sub>2</sub>-efficient solutions are brought to the market.
