            <div data-california-sub-page="0">
                <p>Reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and environmental impact is a high priority for us. Today, there
                    is no perfect alternative
                    to substitute diesel in all applications and all markets in an efficient manner. Therefore, we
                    believe in
                    a long-term transition from fossil fuels to renewable fuels where we utilize a mix of energy
                    sources to reduce
                    CO<sub>2</sub> and pollutant emissions.</p>
                <p>Our strategy differs between urban transport and regional and long haul transport. Click on the
                    operation icons

                    segments.

                <h2>LONG HAUL AND REGIONAL TRANSPORT</h2>
                <p>For regional and long distance transport, we believe that the best solution to reduce the
                    environmental
                    footprint
                    is to remain focused on reducing fuel consumption. Due to the demands on energy efficiency,
                    profitability
                    and operational flexibility, we see that diesel will remain the dominant energy source in the
                    foreseeable
                    future.</p>
                <p>In addition to fuel consumption reduction, we see great potential in using synthetic fuels like HVO
                    to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from a well-to-wheel perspective. That is why all our HD and MD
                    engines are now 100
                    % compatible with these fuels.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, we will progressively electrify our trucks through specific functions
                    and auxiliaries.

                <h2>URBAN TRANSPORT</h2>
                <p>For shorter distances, or closer to urbanized areas, we see CNG as a replacement for diesel. With
                    political pressure to find alternatives to diesel for cities, CNG solutions are increasingly
                    considered. We have sold CNG trucks since 2004, and in 2017 more than 700 of our CNG trucks were on
                    the
                    roads.

                </p>
                <p>Despite this, we see CNG as a transitional fuel. It still emits pollutants and greenhouse gases, and
                    it
                    requires extensive infrastructure deployment. To reach zero emissions in urban areas,
                    electromobility
                    is the answer. We have a robust background in this field, starting with Berlietâ€™s full electric
                    truck
                    in 1923. In 2008 we started collaborating with customers to optimize our first generation of
                    electric
                    vehicles. We have tested many applications, from 3.5 to 16 tonnes. We are now going to the next
                    level
                    with our second generation of electric vehicles; the Z.E. range, a full range of full electric
                    vehicles
                    from 3.1 to 26 tonnes dedicated to urban and peri-urban applications. We are prepared to make
                    electric
                    trucks the new standard for cities by 2025.</p>
