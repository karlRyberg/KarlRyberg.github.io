            <p>Today, the most pressing environmental threat is global warming. It occurs when greenhouse gases such as CO<sub>2</sub>
                are excessively emitted. </p>
            <p>Greenhouse gases trap solar radiation in our atmosphere, thus heating our planet. Without greenhouse gases, Earth
                would not be habitable! However, as we increase our emissions of greenhouse gases, more solar radiation is
                trapped which further increases the temperature. This could lead to climate change, heightened sea levels
                and threatened biodiversity.
