            <p>Over the last three decades, the environmental focus related to trucks has been to reduce polluting
                emissions,
                substances that are directly harmful to our health such as NO<sub>x</sub> and particles, in order to
                improve air quality.</p>
            <p>Through efforts done by the truck industry, supported and driven by legislative actions, major
                improvements have
                been achieved. With the current Euro VI regulation, particulate matter emissions have been reduced by
                97
                % and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions by 98 %.
