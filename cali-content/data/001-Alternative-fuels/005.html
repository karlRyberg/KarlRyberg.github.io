            <p>When discussing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, it is important to consider a well-to-wheel perspective. That means that the carbon footprint
                of the fuelâ€™s whole lifecycle is taken into account, for instance emissions related to the fuel production,
                extraction, transport and distribution, not only the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions produced when the fuel is combusted in the engine (what we call the tank-to-wheel perspective).
            </p>
            <p>This perspective is crucial in order to be able to determine which fuel that is most environmentally sustainable in different applications and regions.</p>
