            <h2>Answer</h2>
            <p>I guess you already know most of this, but Iâ€™ll tell you anyway just to make sure! CNG is non-toxic, but if it
                leaks and is mixed with a specific ratio of air, it can explode if ignited. Therefore, you need to have an
                understanding of the directives related to the risk of explosion adapted by the European Union, often referred
                to as the ATEX directives. The risk of an explosion is low, but to prevent explosions altogether, the ATEX
                directives need to be followed. </p>
            <p>The directives contain information on precautions that need to be taken when working with explosive substances
                such as CNG. In addition to this, the premises used to house a CNG truck need to be designed bearing an explosion
                risk in mind. But since you already have CNG trucks in your fleet, this is probably no news to you!
