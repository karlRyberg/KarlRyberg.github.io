                <h2>Answer</h2>
                <p>We see CNG as a transitional fuel, meaning that it in the long-term will be replaced with even more environmentally
                    friendly fuels such as electricity. Even so, it is the most mature solution currently available. This
                    is also reflected in the current political climate regarding CNG!</p>
                <p>For instance, it is clear that there is support for developing the CNG infrastructure, both from the market
                    and politically. In Europe, a directive was decided on in 2014 requiring member states to improve their
                    alternative fuel infrastructure including CNG. The requirement states that there should be a sufficient
                    number of refuelling stations, ideally every 150 km, to enable operation of CNG vehicles in urban and
                    suburban areas.

                <h2>Answer (cont.)</h2>
                <p>In addition to this, politicians look at other ways to enable the transition towards more environmentally
                    friendly fuels. The CO<sub>2</sub> regulation in the EU is one way of doing this, highlighting which trucks that are most favourable
                    in terms of tailpipe emissions. Several countries are taking legislative action to ease the energy transition.
                    For instance, public purchasers are in some countries required to consider environmental impact when
                    purchasing vehicles. There are also countries which require that vehicles with low environmental impact
                    are selected in tender processes. All in all, this favours CNG solutions!
