            <h2>Answer</h2>
            <p>We are focused on CNG technology, and are motivated to compete with both Iveco as you mentioned and Scania. The main difference
                between us is that both Scania and Iveco offer products both in the CNG and the LNG segment, whereas we have
                chosen to focus only on CNG. LNG has potential when it comes to long haul transport, but due to technical
                and infrastructural challenges with LNG technology, we see it as a limited solution. We also believe that
                the most critical challenges are in urban areas.</p>
            <p>Due to our focus on the CNG offer, which is most relevant to you, our offering is both strong and relevant when
                compared to our main competitors.
