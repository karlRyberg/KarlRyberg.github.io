            <p>In this module, you’ve gotten an introduction to the market situation regarding CNG, but economic incentives
                and political initiatives differ between different countries.</p>
            <p>Take a couple of minutes and investigate local initiatives at your market. To find this, browse the websites
                of your government as well as your local community for anything CNG related. Focus on initiatives and their
                timelines, what effect they could have on your customers’ demand for trucks in the coming years. When you
                have done this, connect with a colleague and share your findings.</p>
            <p> When you are done, continue to the next module.</p>
