            <p>
                You have now explained key differences between the D Wide and the D Wide CNG, and Aurélien was satisfied with your explanation.
                He is now interested in the economic situation when it comes to CNG trucks. As you remember, TCO is of great
                importance to his company.

            </p>
            <p>Which of the following arguments correctly point out economic benefits with CNG vehicles? (One answer is correct.)

            </p>
            <p class="inline-feedback" data-california-quiz-feedback="correct">
                <b>CORRECT!</b>
                <br>You chose the reduced operating cost as an economic benefit with CNG vehicles, which is correct. As you said,
                by transferring to CNG the operating cost can be reduced by up to 18 % which is important aspect to point
                out for our customers. Even though there is often a need for an investment in CNG infrastructure initially,
                the investment can be compensated by the reduced fuel cost.
            </p>

                <b>INCORRECT</b>
                <br>You chose the CNG infrastructure as an economic benefit with CNG vehicles, which is incorrect. The CNG infrastructure
                varies greatly over Europe. In some places it is well-develop, but in some places refuelling infrastructure
                is limited or non-existent. Due to this, we recommend CNG trucks for customers that either can afford to
                build their own CNG fuel infrastructure, or have an existing infrastructure. Installing CNG refuelling infrastructure
                is a big investment and requires a customer with a larger fleet.

                <b>INCORRECT</b>
                <br>You chose the lower price of a CNG truck as an economic benefit with CNG vehicles, which is incorrect. On
                average, a CNG truck is a bit more expensive than its diesel equivalent. However, don’t let this discourage
                your customers, if operating cost is considered instead, a CNG truck can provide an operating cost reduction
                of about 18 %!

                            <input type="checkbox" /> The CNG infrastructure is well-developed all over Europe. That means that Aurélien does not
                            need to invest in a fuelling infrastructure of his own, he can use the already existing refuelling
                            network as he is currently doing with his diesel trucks. There is no additional cost for a CNG
                            vehicle in terms of fuelling infrastructure.

                            <input type="checkbox" /> The D Wide CNG is about 10 % cheaper than its diesel equivalent. This is due to the specific
                            technology used in the truck. There is therefore no additional cost to transfer from diesel to
                            CNG technology when it comes to the vehicle itself.

                        <label>
                            <input type="checkbox" /> On average the operating cost of a CNG vehicle is reduced by 18 % in the European Union, for
                            instance due to reduced fuel costs and no need of AdBlue®. All in all, this can provide great
                            savings over the trucks lifecycle, making a noticeable impact in the TCO.
