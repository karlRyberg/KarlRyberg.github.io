            <p>
                Now that Aurélien understands the environmental benefits of CNG, he gets interested in our CNG offer.

            <p>
                Which of the following features of the D Wide CNG truck are correctly described? (One answer is correct.)
            </p>
            <p class="inline-feedback" data-california-quiz-feedback="correct">
                <b>CORRECT!</b>
                <br>You pointed out the engine as the correctly described key feature of the CNG truck, which is correct! As
                you said, it has the same displacement and power output, but a higher torque. It is a spark ignited engine
                which can run both on natural gas and biogas.
            </p>
            <p class="inline-feedback" data-california-quiz-feedback="incorrect" data-california-quiz-feedback-index="1" data-auto-correct="true">
                <b>INCORRECT</b>
                <br>You pointed out the tanks as the correctly described key feature of the CNG truck, which is incorrect. The
                tanks are a key feature, but are not available with a 60 kg capacity, since that would not be suitable for
                our customers’ operation. The available tank capacities are 90 kg and 120 kg. With the 120 kg tank, the truck
                can have a range of up to 400 km.

                <b>INCORRECT</b>
                <br>You pointed out the focus on the distribution segment as the correctly described key feature of the CNG truck,
                which is incorrect. The information about the distribution segment adaptations were correct, but there is
                also a refuse collection offer which is specifically adapted to that type of operation’s needs. For instance,
                the wheelbase is shortened to be able to navigate narrow streets, and the chassis is prepared for additional
                bodywork.

                            <input type="checkbox" /> The engine has the same displacement and power output as the diesel engine. The torque output
                            is higher than from the diesel version, 1356 Nm compared to 1200 Nm. The engine can run on both
                            natural gas as well as biogas! In addition to that, we offer an Allison automatic transmission
                            that enables high levels of productivity!

                            <input type="checkbox" /> Instead of tanks with liquid fuel, the CNG truck is equipped with gas tanks. Only one tank capacity
                            is available for the truck, 60 kg. With that, the truck has a range of up to 200 km.

                            <input type="checkbox" /> The D Wide CNG offer is only focused on the distribution segment, and is only adapted to that
                            use. For instance, it comes with a long wheelbase to be able to load more goods, higher position
                            for the gas tanks to improve ground clearance and an optimal van body installation.
