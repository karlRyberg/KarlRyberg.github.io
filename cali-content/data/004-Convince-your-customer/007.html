            <p>Congratulations! You’ve convinced Aurélien that investing in CNG trucks for his fleet renewal is a good idea;
                CNG is a mature technology which provides environmental benefits, our CNG offer is strong and there are aspects
                such as fuel cost which can reduce the operating cost of the truck.</p>

            <p>Remember, we want to offer the right fuel, the right truck in the right place. If you see that CNG could be fitting,
                you have numerous arguments and features you could use to convince your customer that the D Wide CNG is the
                correct choice!
            </p>
