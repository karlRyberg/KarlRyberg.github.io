                Let’s put your newly learned CNG knowledge to work!</p>
            <p>Aurélien Julliard, the owner of Colirapid has arrived at your dealership. You welcome him, offer him some coffee
                and ask him to sit down in your office.
            </p>
            <p>Colirapid is a distribution company mainly focused on urban shipments of parcels and post. He currently has a
                fleet consisting of 60 D Wide trucks, but now want to replace them with trucks with less climate impact due
                to a new requirement from his main customer, starting with 10 new trucks. Aurélien has a strong focus on
                total cost of ownership (TCO) and uptime to meet his customer’s demands. Based on your knowledge of Aurélien
                and his company, you think that a D Wide CNG could be suitable.
