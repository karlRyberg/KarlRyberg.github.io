            <p class="inline-feedback" data-california-quiz-feedback="correct">
                <b>CORRECT!</b><br>As you said, CNG is mainly made up of methane, and allows for a reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from a well-to-wheel perspective of between 5 to 15 % compared to diesel. If biogas is used, the reduction can be up to 70 %. Particle emissions are substantially reduced compared to diesel.

                <b>INCORRECT</b><br>That was unfortunately incorrect. The description you chose matches synthetic paraffinic fuels, such as HVO.

                diesel. If biogas is used, the reduction can be up to 70 %. Particle emissions are substantially reduced

                            <input type="checkbox" /> CNG is a compressed gas, produced from feedstock such as rapeseed or sunflower seeds. With CNG,
                            CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be reduced by up to 90 % from a well-to-wheel perspective, but has the
                            same amount of emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> and particles as regular diesel.

                            <input type="checkbox" /> CNG stands for compressed natural gas, and is mainly made up of methane. When combusted, the
                            CO<sub>2</sub>
                            emissions are between 5 to 15 % lower than diesel, but with biogas, created from renewable sources, the well-to-wheel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be reduced by up to 70 %. In addition to that, particle emissions are substantially
                            reduced compared to regular diesel.

                            <input type="checkbox" /> CNG can be made of a number of different energy sources, such as coal, solar and wind energy
                            and biomass. It’s a zero emission fuel, meaning that no particles or NO<sub>x</sub> are emitted. The CO<sub>2</sub>
                            emissions from a well-to-wheel perspective depend on the energy source used to create the fuel.
